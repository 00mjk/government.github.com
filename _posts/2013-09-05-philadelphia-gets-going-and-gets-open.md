A little over a year ago Mark Headd was named the Cheif Data Office for the City of Philadelphia and he hit the ground running using GitHub to help "support some of our core objectives - specifically, collaboration and engagement to provide improved delivery of government services and information." It's a great story for how they went from step one to awesome.

On the very first day he created a new [GitHub account](https://github.com/PhillyCDO "Philadelphia's Data Officer GitHub Account") for the City's Data Officer and posted the city's open data policy as a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/PhillyCDO/3623582).

Next they created a [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/cityofphiladelphia) for the City of Philadelphia. Here the city staff are members of the organization and they put all their public facing code here to share with others and accept pull requests.

One open source app is the [City's Assesment Calculator App](http://avicalculator.phila.gov/) (used earlier this year when new tax assessments were mailed out to all city property owners) which also uses GitHub Pages for free hosting.

Philadelphia is also using GitHub to store and host the data they're opening up. Headd says, "the amazing support for GeoJSON that was announced earlier this year did it for us. We started posting some of our [geospatial data](https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/phl-open-geodata) to GitHub, and we're encouraging our data community to help us convert some of the Shapefiles we already make public into other formats and host them on GitHub."

As if this all wasn't awesome enough, Headd and his team have posted their [Open Government Plan](https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/open-gov-phl) and are using GitHub Issues to get feedback and data requests as well as using GitHub to experiment with better procurement. You can read his overview of the process here. 

Follow the City Philadelphia on GitHub to see what they do next. Send feedback or use one of their projects (and let us know!).
