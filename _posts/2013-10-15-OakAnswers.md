[Oakland Answers](http://answers.oaklandnet.com) was an opensource public private collaboration between OpenOakland, the City of Oakland and our community. 
It is a very simple, searchable tool to find answers to common questions- it works like google, it works on your phone and it's beautiful.

To build this, we gathered 70 people from across our city to build a resource for the entire city as part f the National Day of Civic Hacking.  

We took the raw code originally built for Honolulu by [Code for America](http://www.codeforamerica.org), and forked it on Github, then tweaked it with city staff to create a new resource.

This project served a few important purposes for us- we wanted to build community awareness that they can actually contribute to a city project, a technology project at that! 

We wanted to demonstrate that communities and governments can together create technology and web sites that really meet the needs of the users and the managers - a subtle suggestion that procurement needs fixing..

We also wanted to provide a simple, easy to navigate system to help local businesses, immigrants, parents and nonprofit workers find the simple information they want. No complicated navigation, no departmental indexes, just simple answers.

We will be hosting quarterly hack nights for or community to contribute new questions and answers and to work on technology improvements to this new tool.
