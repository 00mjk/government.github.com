Oakland Answers was an opensource public private collaboration between OpenOakland, the City of Oakland and our community. 
We gathered 70 people from across our city to build a resource for the entire city.  We took the raw code originally built for Honolulu by Code for America, and forked it on Github, then tweaked it with city staff to create a new resource.
