Scientists from the
[Synchrotron Methods Group](http://www.nist.gov/mml/mmsd/synchrotron_methods/index.cfm)
at the
[National Institute of Standards and Technology](http://www.nist.gov)
develop state of-the-art synchrotron X-ray measurement technology,
including instrumentation, methods, and analytical tools, for X-ray
measurement facilities at
[The National Synchrotron Light Source](http://www.bnl.gov/ps).  A
[synchrotron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchrotron) is a
large-scale scientific facilities dedicated to producing intense beams
of X-rays for research applications.  The NSLS is one of
[four such facilties](http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/basic-energy-sciences/)
in the United States operated by the Department of Energy and one of
[about fifty worldwide](http://www.lightsources.org/light-source-facility-information).
The instrumentation and methodology develop at a rapid pace, requiring
novel software tools to make effective use of the data measured.

As a system for linking the advanced capabilities of the backend
scientific tools to useful and expressive user interfaces,
[Demeter](https://github.com/bruceravel/demeter) allows scientists to
use data measured at synchrotron facilities from around the world to
the fullest extent, enabling significant advances in many of the
scientific areas most important to society.

XAS is a way of probing the electronic and atomic structure of matter
using X-rays.  With XAS, a researcher can understand the properties
and behavior of materials by understanding how the atoms in the
material stack together.  XAS plays a central role in a wide variety
of scientific activities.  It is essential to researchers of many
disciplines:

 * _energy science_: batteries, fuel cells, catalytic materials,
   photovoltaic materials
 * _materials science_: components for computers and electronics
 * _environmental science_: the fate and trasport of contaminant
   metals in natural systems
 * _life science_: the role of metals in proteins and tissues
 * _art and archeology_: studies of pigments and metals used to make
   objects of cultural or historical significance

In short, XAS has an impact on many of the areas of scientific
activity that have the greatest impact on life and society.

[Demeter](https://github.com/bruceravel/demeter) is scientific
software for the processing and analysis of data from a measurement
technique called
[X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EXAFS).
[Demeter](https://github.com/bruceravel/demeter) is built using
various open source tools. including [Perl](http://www.perl.org),
[wxWidgets](http://www.wxwidgets.org/),
[Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info), and others.  It also depends upon
the scientific software efforts of various academic collaborators,
including [Feff](http://www.feffproject.org/),
[Ifeffit](https://github.com/newville/ifeffit), and
[Larch](https://github.com/xraypy/xraylarch).

The programs built using Demeter -- Athena (for XAS data processing),
Artemis (for quantitative XAS data analysis), and Hephaestus (a
souped-up periodic table for the XAS practitioner) -- enable thousands
of scientists from around the country and around the world to make
scientific progress using XAS.
