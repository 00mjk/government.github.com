[Demeter](https://github.com/bruceravel/demeter) is scientific software for the processing and analysis of a measurement technique called X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS).  This is a technique familiar to users of the United States Department of Energy's synchrotron radiation facilities

XAS is a way of probing the electronic and atomic structure of matter using X-rays.  With XAS a researcher can understand the properties of materials by understanding how the atoms in the material stack together.  XAS plays a central role in a broad field of scientific activities and is essential to researchers working in such disparate areas as batteries, fuel cells, catalytic materials, materials for electronics, photovoltaic materials, the fate and trasport of contaminant metals in natural systems, and the role of metals in proteins and other organic materials.

Scientists working in all those fields (and others!) visit the four DOE facilities and over five dozen other such facilities around the world.  While XAS is certainly not the only measurement technique performed at synchrotron facilities, it is one of the core competancies of synchrotron science.

[Demeter](https://github.com/bruceravel/demeter) is the work of Bruce Ravel, a physicist at the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](http://www.nist.gov).  In my position in the [Synchrotron Science Group](http://www.nist.gov/mml/mmsd/synchrotron_methods/index.cfm) of the [Materials Measurement Laboratory](http://www.nist.gov/mml/index.cfm), I operate [beamline X23A2](http://beamlines.ps.bnl.gov/beamline.aspx?blid=X23A2) at the National Synchrotron Light Source.  X23A2 is dedicated to XAS measurements and hosts visits by dozens of scientists from government, academia, and industry every year.

[Demeter](https://github.com/bruceravel/demeter) is built using various open source tools. including Perl, wxWidgets, and others.  It also depends upon the scientific software efforts of various academic collaborators, including [Feff](http://www.feffproject.org/), [Ifeffit](https://github.com/newville/ifeffit), and [Larch](https://github.com/xraypy/xraylarch).

[Demeter](https://github.com/bruceravel/demeter) is a system for linking the capabilities of the backend scientific tool to useful and expressive user interfaces.  The programs built using Demeter -- Athena (for XAS data processing), Artemis (for quantittive XAS data analysis), and Hephaestus (a souped-up periodic table for the XAS practitioner) -- are in use by many hundreds of scientists worldwide.
