[Demeter](https://github.com/bruceravel/demeter) is scientific
software for the processing and analysis of a measurement technique
called X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS).  This is a technique
familiar to users of the Department of Energy's synchrotron radiation
facilities

  * [The National Synchrotron Light Source](http://www.bnl.gov/ps)

XAS is a way of probing the electronic and atomic structure of matter
using X-rays.  With XAS, a researcher can understand the properties of
materials by understanding how the atoms in the material stack
together.  XAS plays a central role in a broad field of scientific
activities and is essential to researchers working in such disparate
areas as batteries, fuel cells, catalytic materials, materials for
electronics, photovoltaic materials, the fate and trasport of
contaminant metals in natural systems, and the role of metals in
proteins and other organic materials.

Scientists from the
[Synchrotron Methods Group](http://www.nist.gov/mml/mmsd/synchrotron_methods/index.cfm)
at the
[National Institute of Standards and Technology](http://www.nist.gov)
develop state of-the-art synchrotron X-ray measurement technology,
including instrumentation, methods, and analytical tools, for
beamlines at [The National Synchrotron Light Source](http://www.bnl.gov/ps).
The instrumentation and methodology develop at a rapid pace, requiring
novel software tools to make effective use of the data measured.

[Demeter](https://github.com/bruceravel/demeter) is built using
various open source tools. including [Perl](http://www.perl.org),
[wxWidgets](http://www.wxwidgets.org/), and others.  It also depends
upon the scientific software efforts of various academic
collaborators, including [Feff](http://www.feffproject.org/),
[Ifeffit](https://github.com/newville/ifeffit), and
[Larch](https://github.com/xraypy/xraylarch).

[Demeter](https://github.com/bruceravel/demeter) is a system for
linking the capabilities of the backend scientific tool to useful and
expressive user interfaces which allow scientists to use data measured
at synchrotron facilities to the fullest extent.  The programs built
using Demeter -- Athena (for XAS data processing), Artemis (for
quantittive XAS data analysis), and Hephaestus (a souped-up periodic
table for the XAS practitioner) -- are in use by many hundreds of
scientists around the country and around the world.
