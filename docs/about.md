#### GitHub is a company and GitHub.com, GitHub Enterprise, GitHub for Mac and more are things we built to make working together easier. 

### GitHub, Inc

GitHub is the best place to build software together. Over 4 million people use GitHub to share code and build amazing things with friends, co-workers, classmates, and complete strangers. Originally founded by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, and PJ Hyett to simplify sharing code, GitHub has grown into the largest code host in the world. Our headquarters are in San Francisco, California but our team is distributed all over the globe -- we use GitHub to build GitHub!

##### GitHub.com

GitHub is based on, and extends the social functionality, of an open-source [distributed version control system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control) known as [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)). In essence, Git keeps a running log of all changes to a software project. Each time you make a change, you describe that change (a commit message) and then push that change to GitHub. GitHub also allows members of the public to "[fork](/glossary/#fork)" existing projects, improve upon them, and then submit their changes back upstream as a "[pull request](/glossary/#pull_request)."

GitHub offers free public repositories for open source projects as well as subscription-based private repositories for closed projects. Agencies should create an organization account with GitHub, which can include an unlimited number of individual developer accounts. See [Records](#Records) below for more information.

##### GitHub Enterprise

The vast majority of GitHub's users use GitHub.com. This means the code is hosted on our servers. Some large organizations have their own servers and want to use the GitHub interface to collaborate on code that is just shared internally, for this there is GitHub Enterprise. It's all of the same features of GitHub.com except it's hosted on your organization's servers. Because GitHub Enterpise is installed on your own servers, the repositories cannot be contributed to by the open source developers or forked by other organizations - but that's ok, many organizations that run GitHub Enterprise locally and also have a GitHub.com account for the projects they wish to open source to the public.

##### Gov Team

We have a gov team and we'd love to here from you. You can reach us at gov@github.com.
