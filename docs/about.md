### GitHub, Inc

GitHub is the best place to build software together. Over 4 million people use GitHub to share code and build amazing things with friends, co-workers, classmates, and complete strangers. Originally founded by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, and PJ Hyett to simplify sharing code, GitHub has grown into the largest code host in the world. Our headquarters are in San Francisco, California but our team is distributed all over the globe -- we use GitHub to build GitHub!

##### GitHub.com

GitHub.com is a hosted (SaaS) social collaboration platform that is based on an open-source [distributed version control system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control) known as [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)). In essence, Git keeps a running log of all changes to a software project. Each time you make a change, you describe that change (a commit message) and then push that change to GitHub. GitHub also allows members of the public to [fork](/glossary/#fork) existing projects, improve upon them, and then submit their changes back upstream as a "[pull request](/glossary/#pull_request)."

GitHub offers free public repositories for open source projects as well as subscription-based private repositories for closed projects. Agencies should create an organization account with GitHub, which can include an unlimited number of individual developer accounts. 

##### GitHub Enterprise

Want to run GitHub with your own datacenter, then GitHub Enterprise is for you. Ideal for collaborating on sensitive projects or projects bound by export restorations, GitHub Enterprise is the same GitHub.com but experience packaged as a virtual appliance that you can host yourself. Many organizations that run GitHub Enterprise internally for sensitive projects also have a GitHub.com account for the projects they wish to open source to the public.

##### Government Team

We have a team focused on helping governments and we'd love to here from you. You can reach us at [government@github.com](mailto:government.github.com).
