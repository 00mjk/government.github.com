## Feedback Repository

Get feedback from your local development community by creating a specific repository for them to contribute ideas and suggetions for types of data or other information they'd like to see opened.

1. Create a new repository
	- Name it Feedback or similar
	- Select to initiate with a README.md
2. Set up your Readme
	- Click readme.md
	- Click Edit
	- Introduce yourself, describe why you've joined GitHub, what you're hoping to do and what you'd like to learn from the development community. Encourage them to leave feadback through issues on the repository.

Sample text for your readme.md:

	# City of Gotham Feedback
	We've just joined GitHub and want to know what data would be interesting to our develoment community?
	Leave us comments via issues!

## Open a Dataset

Opening a dataset can be as simple as uploading a .csv or Excel file to GitHub and letting people know about it. GitHub can host any file type and will actually render a few of them, too. For instance, if you get a .geoJSON file from your GIS department and put it on GitHub, it will be rendered as a map.

## Fork this Repo

The code for this website is open source! If you see something that needs improving, you can fork the repo, make a change and then submit a pull request. We'd love the feedback and it's a great way to learn the tools of GitHub.

## Standup an App

There are many open source apps on GitHub that were built specifically for government. To "standup" an app is to get it running in your locale. The Civic Common's website is a great resource for examples. Here are a few:

###### Adopt-a
This open source web app ([its GitHub repository](#))was created for the City of Boston in 2011 by [Code for America](http://www.codeforamerica.org) fellows. It allows residents to "adopt" a hydrant and make sure it's clear of snow in the winter so that emergency crews can locate them when needed. It has since been adopted in **Chicago** (for sidewalks), **Seattle**(for storm drains), **Honolulu** (for tsunami sirens).

###### StreetMix
