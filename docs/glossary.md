description: No doubt all this GitHub and openness comes with a lot of new vocabulary. Most of the time the word is new but the concept is not; we've got them defined for you here.

* **Branches** - A branch is a parallel version of another branch. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or `master` branch allowing you to work without disrupting the main file. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the `master` branch.
* **Clone** - A clone is a [local](#) copy of a [repository](#) on your computer. With your clone you can edit the files in your preferred editor and use Git to keep track of your changes without having to be online. You can [push](#) your local changes to the [remote](#) to keep them synced when you're online.
* **Collaborator** - Someone who has been invited by an admin to contribute to a repository and therefore has the ability to make and approve changes.
* **Commits** - A commit is an individual change to a file (or set of files). It's like when you _save_ a file, except with Git, every time you save it creates a unique id that allows you to keep record of what changes where made when and by who. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made.
* **Diff** - This is simply the _difference_ in changes between two commits, or saved changes. The diff will show what was added or removed from a file since its last commit.
* **Fork** - A fork is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original. Forks remain attached to the original, allowing you to submit a [pull request](#Pull-Request) to the original's author to update with your changes. You can also keep your fork up to date by [pulling](#Pull) in updates from the original.
* **Git** - Git is an open source protocol for tracking changes in text-based code. It was built by Linus, who also write the Linux operating sytem, and is the core technology that GitHub, the social and user interface, is built on top of.
* **Issues** - Issues are suggested improvements, tasks or questions related to the repository. Issues can be created by anyone (for public repositories), and are moderated by repository collaborators. Each issue contains its own discussion forum, can be labeled and assigned to a user.
* **Local** - This is a version of something that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere [remote](#). It is, however, contected to the remote version so that changes can be synced between the two.
* **Markdown** - is a file type for text documents just like .doc, .rtf or .txt. The difference is that markdown files can include a bit of semantics to designate when a word should be link or an image should be embedded. It's an easy way to write text and have it displayed like a website. GitHub supports markdown and you can learn about the semantics [here](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown).
* **Open Source** - refers to source code that has been made freely available to use, iterate on or contribute to. 
* **Organizations** - Organizations are a group two or more users together. They are administered by users who are admins of the organization and can contain both [repositories](#Repositories) and teams.
* **Private Repository** - These are respositories that can only be seen by their creator and the collaborators they've invited. They're hosted on GitHub.com but must be purchased through a [plan](http://www.gitub.com/plans).
* **Pull** - refers to when you are taking _in_ changes. For instance, if someone has edited the [remote](#remote) file you're both working on, you'll want to _pull_ in those changes to your [local](#local) copy so that it's up to date.
* **Push** - refers to when you are adding changes to a file. For instance, if you change something [locally](local), you'd want to then _push_ those changes to the [remote](#remote) so that they're in sync.
* **Pull Request** - Pull requests are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository collaborator. Like issues, pull requests each have their own discussion forum.
* **Remote** - This is the version of something that is hosted on a server somewhere. It can be connected to [local](#) [clones](#) so that changes are can be synced.
* **Repositories** - Repositories are the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the projects files (including documentation), and store each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.
* **Users** - These are personal GitHub accounts. Each user has a personal profile, and can own multiple repositories, public or private. They can create or be invited to join organizations or collaborate on another users repository.
