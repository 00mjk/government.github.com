No doubt all this GitHub and openness comes with a lot of new vocabulary. Most of the time the word is new but the concept is not; we've got them defined for you here.

* **Users** - These are personal GitHub accounts. Each user has a personal profile, and can own multiple repositories, public or private. They can create or be invited to join organizations.
* **Organizations** - Organizations group two or more users together. They are administered by users, and can contain both repositories and teams.
* **Repositories** - Repositories are the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the projects files (including documentation), and store each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either [public](#Public-Repository) or [private](#Private-Repository).
* **Commits** - A commit is an individual change to a file (or set of files). It's like when you _save_ a file, except with Git, every time you save it creates a unique id that allows you to keep record of what changes where made when and by who. Commit's usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made.
* **Diff** - This is simply the _difference_ in changes between two commits, or saved changes. The diff will show what was added or removed from a file since it's last commit.
* **Branches** - A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or `master` branch allowing you to work without disrupting the main file. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the `master` branch.
* **Issues** - Issues are suggested improvements, tasks, or action items. Issues can be created by anyone (for public repositories), and are moderated by repository collaborators. Each issue contains its own discussion forum, can be labeled and assigned to a user.
* **Fork** - A fork is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives in your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original. Forks remain attached to the original, allowing you to submit a [pull request](#Pull-Request) to the original's author to update with your changes as well as keep your fork up to date by [pulling](#Pull) in updates from the original.
* **Pull Request** - Pull requests are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository collaborator. Like issues, pull requests each have their own discussion forum.
* **Clone** - A clone is a [local](#) copy of a [repository](#) on your computer. With your clone you can edit the files in your favorite editor and use Git to keep track of your changes without having to be online. You can [push](#) your local changes to the [remote](#) to keep them synced.
* **Local** - This is a version of something that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere [remote](#). It is, however, contected to the remote version so that changes can be synced between the two.
* **Remote** - This is the version of something that is hosted on a server somewhere. It can be connected to [local](#) [clones](#) so that changes are able to be synced.
* **Git** - Git is an open source protocol for tracking changes in text-based code. It was built by Linus, who also write the Linux operating sytem, and is the core technology that GitHub, the social interface, is built on top of.
* **Private Repository** - These are respositories that can only be seen by their creator and the collaborators they've invited. They're hosted on GitHub.com but must be purchased through a plan.
* **Open Source** - refers to source code that has been made freely available to use, iterate on or contribute to. 
* **Push** - refers to when you are adding changes to an out of date file. For instance, if you change something [locally](local), you'd want to then _push_ those changes to the [remote](#remote) so that they're in sync.
* **Pull** - refers to when you are taking in changes. For instance, if someone has edited the [remote](#remote) file you're both working on, you'll want to _pull_ in those changes to your [local](#local) copy so that it's up to date.
* **Markdown** - is a file type for text documents, just like .doc, .rtf or .txt. The differences is that markdown files can contain just a bit of semantics to designate when a word should be link or an image should be inbedded. It's an easy way to write text and have it displayed like a website. GitHub supports markdown and you can learn about the semantics [here](http://github.com/).
