		<h2>Share</h2>
		<p>GitHub makes it easy to share by generating urls for files, even for specific lines of text in a file. Forget emails and attachments, just ping another users and paste a link -- we call that, the GitHub flow.</p>

		<h2>Your Datacener or the Cloud</h2>
		<p>If you've got your own servers and want to run GitHub just within your agency, GitHub Enterprise has got you covered. If you don't want to worry about servers, we'll handle that for you and GitHub.com is your choice.</p>
