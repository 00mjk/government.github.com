	<h2>Collaborate</h2>
	<img src="/assets/img/collaborating.png">
	<p class="mini-section">GitHub Issues lets you create discussion around text, proposed changes or just ideas. You can imbed images (<strong>A</strong>), ping other users or teams (<strong>B</strong>) and write in Markdown.</p>

	<h2>View</h2>
	<img src="/assets/img/view.png">
	<p class="mini-section">Visualizing data or text is lovely here. GitHub automatically creates maps (<strong>A</strong>) from .geoJSON files, tables (<strong>B</strong>) from .CSV, renders .markdown, shows the differences between saves of text (<strong>C</strong>) <em>and</em> images.</p>

	<h2>Share</h2>
	<img src="/assets/img/share.png">
	<p class="mini-section">GitHub makes it easy to share by generating urls for files, even for specific lines of text in a file (<strong>A</strong>). Forget emails and attachments, just ping another user and copy and paste a link -- we call that, the GitHub flow.</p>

	<div style="width: 48%; float: left;">
		<h2>In your Datacenter or the Cloud</h2>
		<img src="/assets/img/cloud.png">
		<p class="mini-section" >If you've got your own servers and want to run GitHub just within your agency, <a href="http://enterprise.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub Enterprise</a> has got you covered. If you don't want to worry about servers, we'll handle that for you and <a href="http://www.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub.com</a> is your choice.</p>

	<div style="width: 48%; float: right;">
		<h2>The Largest Open Source Network</h2>
		<img src="/assets/img/fivemillion.png">
		<p class="mini-section">GitHub is the word's largest open source network. With over 5 million users to learn from or get contributions from.</p>
