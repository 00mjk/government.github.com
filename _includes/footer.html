            <h4>About this site</h4>
            <p>At GitHub we love collaboration and we love the things we’ve seen and believe are possible when government makes use of GitHub. We’ve even got someone dedicated to this beautiful relationship, Ben Balter.</p>

            <p>Featured content on this site is curated by GitHub. We love reading about what’s going on and capturing stories directly from our government users. <p>
