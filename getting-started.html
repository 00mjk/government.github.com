        <p>When you sign up for an account on GitHub.com, we host your files and your organization becomes a part of the world's largest open source community. You create both public and private repositories (projects) on GitHub.com. Public repositories are always free, see our plans for <a href="https://github.com/plans">private repositories</a>.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="span4">
        <p>Some users have both a free GitHub.com account for public repositories and a <a href="https://enterprise.github.com/">GitHub Enterprise</a> account. GitHub Enterprise gives users who wish to host files on their own servers to do so and run the same GitHub experience on a local network.</p>

    <h3>1. Review the Terms</h3>
    <p>It may sound like a boring first step, but many government agencies can't just simply click sign up like you would if you were at home. The good news is we've worked out a <a href="#">government friendly addendum</a> to our standard terms of service. Simply have your general council's office give it a quick once over, and you should be good to go!</p>

  <div class="span4">
    <h3>2. Sign Up</h3>
    <p>The hard work is already done. Creating a GitHub organization happens in two steps. First, if you don't have one already, create a GitHub user account by visiting <a href="http://github.com/">github.com</a> and picking a username and password. The username should be personal to you, just like any other social network. Second, pick a name that represents your agency, and <a href="https://github.com/account/organizations/new">create an organization</a>.</p>

    <h3>3. Dive in</h3>
    <p>You're all set. Now comes the fun stuff. <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository">Create your first repository</a>, <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo">fork someone else's code</a>, and most importantly <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/be-social">be social</a>, after all, GitHub's about building communities. It may be helpful to install <a href="http://windows.github.com/">GitHub for Windows</a> or <a href="http://mac.github.com/">Mac</a>, or if you feel comfortable <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git">dive into the command line</a>. Welcome to GitHub.</p>
