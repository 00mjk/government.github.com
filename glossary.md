* **Users** - GitHub's a social network and is about helping people ("humans") work better, together. Each user has a personal profile, and can own multiple repositories.
* **Organizations** - Organizations group two or more users together. They are administered by users, and can contain both repositories and teams.
* **Repositories** - Repositories are the most basic element of GitHub. They contain files (including documentation), and store each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.
* **Commits** - A commit is an individual change to a file (or set of files). Commits are unique identifiable and track who made what change when.
* **Diff** - The comparison of changes between two or more commits.
* **Branches** - A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or `master` branch. Changes from branches can easily be merged.
* **Issues** - Issues are suggested improvements, tasks, or action items. Issues can be created by anyone (for public repositories), and are moderated by repository collaborators. Each issue contains its own discussion forum.
* **Fork** - A fork is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives in your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original.
* **Pull Request** - Pull requests are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository collaborator. Like issues, pull requests each have their own discussion forum.
* **Clone** - 
* **Local** -
* **Remote** -
* **Git** -
* **Private Repository** - 
* [**Open source software**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) - is a collaborative model of software development whereby the human-readable source code used to produce a given piece of software is made freely available for others to adapt or improve upon as they see fit. Most often (although not always) such development efforts occur publicly, and may involve many disparate groups of developers contributing to the project (rather than a single software firm or a single agency).

Open source software (sometimes known as free, open source software or FOSS) represents a forward-thinking political philosophy, not an alternate software development workflow or business model. In this context, the word "free" refers to free as in speech, not "free" as in beer. In fact, there's no reason you can't sell open source software, or even make a living producing it. Many large, private sector firms (Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, Google to name a few) are actually extremely influential members of the open source community.
